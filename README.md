# PWA-ReactJS

Progressive Web App for a fake conference built with ReactJS

## Background
When I go to a conference, I have to load the webpage several times during the day to see the schedule and check the location and time of the talks I'm interested in.

## So why not make it a PWA?
With a PWA, the initial data is stored in cache and you can easily and quickly retrieve it, regardless of your internet connection.
